#  01 – Figma Basics

This folder is where I’m documenting my early journey with **Figma** the tool I’m using to learn UI/UX design from the ground up. It includes personal notes, practice files, and lessons I’m picking up along the way.

## What is Figma?

Figma is an online design tool that lets you create user interfaces, wireframes, and prototypes right in the browser. It's beginner-friendly, powerful, and lets me build designs visually.


## Here’s what I’ve been exploring and experimenting with:

- ✅ Creating **frames** (basically digital canvases/screens)
- 🧩 Adding and organizing **text**, **shapes**, and **icons**
- 📏 Using **alignment tools**, **spacing guides**, and **grouping**
- 🎨 Playing with **colors**, **fonts**, and **layers**
- 🔘 Making basic **buttons**, cards, and layout ideas

## Practice Folder 📁
- includes  Redesign a Mobile Login Screen
- Simple Card UI
- Promotion Card 
- Design System

## Why I'm Learning Figma

As someone starting with UI/UX, I want to understand how interfaces are designed before I code them. Figma helps me build a visual sense for:

- Clean layouts
- Proper spacing
- Accessible design
- Visual consistency


## What's Next?

I’m planning to level up by:

- Creating a small **design system** (think: reusable buttons, input fields, color styles)
- Practicing **auto layout** and learning how **components** work
- Building clickable **prototypes** to simulate user flows
