#  01 – Figma Basics

This folder contains my personal notes, practice files, and learnings as I start exploring Figma—the tool I'm using to learn UI/UX design.

## What is Figma?

Figma is an online design tool that lets you create user interfaces, wireframes, and prototypes right in the browser. It's beginner-friendly, powerful, and lets me build designs visually.

##  What I've Learned So Far

-  Creating frames (like artboards or screens)
-  Adding text, shapes, and icons
-  Using alignment, spacing, and grouping tools
-  Playing with colors, fonts, and layers
-  Making simple buttons and layout mockups

## Why I'm Learning Figma

As someone starting with UI/UX, I want to understand how interfaces are designed before I code them. Figma helps me build a visual sense for:

- Layout
- Spacing
- Accessibility
- Design consistency

## What's Next?

- Building a small design system (buttons, input fields, colors)
- Trying auto layout and components
- Prototyping simple interactions
