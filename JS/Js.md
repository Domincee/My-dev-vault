# JS Practice Vault

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to practicing interactive JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Here, I explore and experiment with:

- **JavaScript** fundamentals and advanced concepts
- **HTML** structure and semantics
- **CSS** styling and layouts
- **DOM Manipulation** for dynamic, interactive web pages
- **GRID Layouts** for responsive web page and mobile
Feel free to browse through the examples and code snippets as I build my skills in front-end web development.
