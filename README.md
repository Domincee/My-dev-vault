# My-dev-vault
A personal learning vault documenting my journey from UI/UX and front-end to full-stack software engineering.


Hey there! 👋
I'm Domince Aseberos, a 21-year-old Computer Science student from the Philippines. I’m on a journey to become a software engineer—starting with the creative world of UI/UX, diving into front-end development, and slowly working my way deeper into tech.

This repo is where I keep all my learnings—everything I study, build, and explore in web development.

🚀 My Learning Path
I’m taking it one step at a time. Right now, I’m focused on:

🎨 UI/UX Design – Figma, wireframes, and building clean design systems

💻 Front-End Development – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React

🧠 Up Next – Back-end development, data structures & algorithms, full-stack projects

📁 What You’ll Find Here
This repo is like my digital notebook. Here’s how I’ve organized everything:

ui-ux/ – Notes on Figma, design principles, and case studies
html-css/ – Layouts, responsive designs, and styling best practices
javascript/ – Core JS concepts, DOM work, and small challenges
front-end/ – React, Tailwind, and modern front-end tools
future-learning/ – Prep for back-end and other goals

projects/ – Mini builds, portfolio experiments, and fun ideas

🧭 Why I Made This
I wanted a place where I could learn out loud, track my progress, and stay organized.
This repo helps me stay accountable—and if it helps someone else out there too, that’s even better!

✨ A Quote That Keeps Me Going
“Step by step, I’m learning, building, and improving.”

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s keep growing. 🌱
